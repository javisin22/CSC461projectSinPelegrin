# CSC461 24/25 Final Project

This repository contains the code, presentation and report for the Final Project of the CSC461 (Machine Learning) course at the University of Rhode Island.

In order to properly use the code, it will be required to download a pre-trained embedding from the Standford Natural Language Processing group, that can be found on their official website. There's a link to it in the Final Report.

Feel free to view all the content of the repository and experiment with the models :).
